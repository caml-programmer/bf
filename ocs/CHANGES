1.0.1

    - Fix sorting of byte code objects in Makefile.

    - Add missing functions numerator and denominator.

    - Keep rationals normalized.

1.0 (changes from pre-releases)

    - Rearrange build to generate bytecode and native libraries and a
    native interpreter usable from the command line.

    - Remove CVS Id's (the project is now being stored in a GNU Arch
    repository) from all files.

    - Fix Ocs_port.string_input_port to actually initialize the
    port with the string length.

    - Fix internal definitions of the form (define (fun args ...) ...).
    Previously the first item of the body would be skipped.

    - Fix the order of arguments to atan when called with two arguments.

    - When invoking continuations with multiple arguments, the
    arguments are now wrapped with Svalues as if (values ...) were used.
